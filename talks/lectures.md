<u>Background:</u> Philosophy + Theology => Information Technology (Persuasive Designs: Bayesian Networks)

<u>The False Gods of Data Science</u>
- Omniscient: 
    Data => EDA + Features Voodoo + Black Magic (Modeling) + Evaluation Metrics

    * Problems:
        - [ ] EDA 
        - [ ] Features 
        - [ ] Models
        - [ ] Metrics

- Data is King

```text
Without a determinant understanding of what you are measuring, data can’t be used in a meaningful way. However, when you add context by describing precisely what you’re measuring and why—only then can it be useful for interpreting specific things.

In other words, without context and meaning, data is simply meaningless vanity metrics embedded in pretty charts.
