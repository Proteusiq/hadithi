Without a determinant understanding of what you are measuring, data canâ€™t be used in a meaningful way. 
However, when you add context by describing precisely what youâ€™re measuring and whyâ€”only then can it be useful for interpreting specific things.

In other words, without context and meaning, data is simply meaningless vanity metrics embedded in pretty charts.
