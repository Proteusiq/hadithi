# Hadithi
🧪 Data Science | ⚒️ MLOps | ⚙️ DataOps : Talks about 🦄

_Hadithi_ is a Swahili word for story | stories. These are collections of successful and failed projects stories, building ML projects that lasts, design pattern, code testing, and how to navigate in rapidly changing Tech landscape. These stories, sagas and opinions are my own. They neither reflect the companies I have worked or working for nor should they be taken seriously.

### [_Sura ya Kwanza_](https://github.com/Proteusiq/hadithi/tree/main/mlfluke)
Understanding machine learning predictions. What you see is not always what you get 🤖. 

### [_Sura ya Pili_](https://github.com/Proteusiq/hadithi/tree/main/pipelines) 
Data should always be piped to insure traceability. Testing different Python pipelines 〰.

### [_Sura ya Tatu_](https://github.com/Proteusiq/hadithi/tree/main/timeseries)
What about time series analysis? A tour of Python time series analysis packages 📦.

### Makelele: Noise

ML projects are less about algorithms and more about data pipelines. Data pipelines, and not machine learning algorithms, are the soul of the project. They are the path towards desired destination. Algorithms, are though, vehicles. 
Well built roads allows us to travel far and fast. Without them, we are barely moving. The path to our desired destination would be slow or worst stuck.
