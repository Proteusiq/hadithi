# Hadithi
🧪 Data Science | ⚒️ MLOps | ⚙️ DataOps : Talks about 🦄

_Hadithi_ is Swahili word for story | stories. These are collections of successful and failed projects stories, building ML projects that lasts, design pattern, code testing, and how to navigate in rapidly changing Tech landscape. These stories, sagas and opinions are my own. They neither reflect the companies I have worked or working in nor should they be taken seriously.
